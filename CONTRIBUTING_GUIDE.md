# Mini Hack Cohort 1 — Builder Contribution Guide
## Payments on Avalanche | Team1 Kenya | 2026

This guide covers everything you need to complete your weekly quests, submit your work, and stay on track from Week 1 through Demo Day. Read it once at the start of the cohort and refer back to it whenever you are unsure what to do next.

If something is not clear, post in the Telegram group before you guess. A wrong submission costs you points and time.

## How the cohort works

Mini Hack Cohort 1 runs for four weeks — eight sessions total, two per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:00 PM EAT on Google Meet at [meet.google.com/wcm-gmct-cbt](https://meet.google.com/wcm-gmct-cbt).

Every week you have two things to submit before Sunday midnight EAT:

**1. A GitHub pull request** — your actual code. This is the technical deliverable. It lives on your fork of the template repo and is reviewed by the technical lead or a module lead.

**2. Tally quest submissions** — evidence of your work. Screenshots, Snowtrace links, terminal output, certificate PDFs, reflections. Each quest is a separate field in that week's Tally form. The Tally submissions feed directly into the leaderboard at [minihacktracker.vercel.app](https://minihacktracker.vercel.app).

Both must be done by the same deadline. A GitHub PR without Tally quests is incomplete. Tally quests without a GitHub PR link are incomplete.

---

## Weekly workflow — step by step

Follow this exact process every week, every time. No deviations.

### Step 1 — Pull the latest from the template

Before starting each week, sync your fork with the template repo to get any new starter code or resources added for that week:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Talent-Index/minihack-cohort1-template.git
# Only run the line above once — skip it on subsequent weeks

git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Step 2 — Create your weekly branch

Branch naming is mandatory. Use this exact format every single week:

```bash
git checkout -b week-{N}-{your-github-handle}
```

Examples:
```bash
git checkout -b week-1-scotch
git checkout -b week-2-wanjiku
git checkout -b week-3-kipchoge
```

A PR with the wrong branch name is flagged immediately and sent back to you to fix.

### Step 3 — Do your work on that branch

Build the week's deliverable on your branch. Commit often. Write commit messages that describe what you actually did — not `fix` or `update`:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "add ERC-20 PaymentSplitter with 70/30 split logic"
git commit -m "deploy PaymentSplitter to Fuji — tx hash 0x..."
git commit -m "add unit test for zero-amount revert case"

# Bad commit messages
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "wip"
git commit -m "asdfgh"
```

Your commit history is visible to reviewers and contributes to your code quality score.

### Step 4 — Push your branch

```bash
git push origin week-{N}-{your-github-handle}
```

### Step 5 — Open a pull request

Go to `github.com/YOUR-HANDLE/minihack-cohort1-template` and open a pull request from your weekly branch into the `main` branch of **your own fork** — not into the Talent-Index template repo.

**PR title format — mandatory:**

```
[Cohort 1 Week N] Your Full Name - Deliverable title
```

Examples:
```
[Cohort 1 Week 1] Joseph Njoroge - Hello Avalanche transaction on Fuji
[Cohort 1 Week 2] Wanjiku Kamau - PaymentSplitter and Escrow deployed to Fuji
[Cohort 1 Week 3] Isaac Kipchoge - STK Push integration with Core Wallet frontend
```

When you open the PR, a template appears automatically. **Fill in every single section.** A PR with blank sections will not be reviewed. The template asks for:

- What you built
- What works
- What does not work yet
- Your Snowtrace link (required from Week 2)
- Your deployed frontend URL (required from Week 3)
- Notes for the reviewer

Within 30 seconds of opening the PR, the automated welcome bot posts a comment confirming your submission is in and listing the pre-review checklist. If you do not see that comment, something went wrong — check the Actions tab on your fork.

### Step 6 — Post your PR link in Telegram

Copy your full PR URL and post it in the Telegram group submissions thread. Tag it with your cohort and week:

```
[Cohort 1 Week 2] PR submitted
https://github.com/YOUR-HANDLE/minihack-cohort1-template/pull/N
```

This must be done before Sunday midnight EAT.

### Step 7 — Complete your Tally quests

Go to that week's Tally form link (posted in Telegram and on the programme site) and submit evidence for each quest. Include your GitHub PR link in the Tally submission — it is a required field.

All quests must be completed on Tally before Sunday midnight EAT — same deadline as your PR.

Your Tally submissions feed the leaderboard automatically. Check your standing at [minihacktracker.vercel.app](https://minihacktracker.vercel.app).

## How to submit on Tally

1. Go to that week's Tally form link — posted in Telegram and on the programme site
2. Fill in your name, email, and GitHub username
3. Paste your GitHub PR link — this is required on every form
4. Work through each quest field in order — upload files, paste links, paste terminal output
5. Hit Submit

**Do not leave fields empty.** A Tally submission with missing quest fields will not count for those quests. You can resubmit but only the first submission is counted on the leaderboard timestamp — so get it right the first time.

After submitting, check the leaderboard at [minihacktracker.vercel.app](https://minihacktracker.vercel.app) within a few minutes to confirm your submission appeared.

---

## How to open a GitHub PR

1. Push your weekly branch: `git push origin week-{N}-{your-handle}`
2. Go to `github.com/YOUR-HANDLE/minihack-cohort1-template`
3. GitHub shows a banner saying your branch was recently pushed — click **Compare and pull request**
4. Verify the base is `main` on **your own fork** — not on Talent-Index
5. Set the PR title using the format: `[Cohort 1 Week N] Your Name - Deliverable title`
6. Fill in every section of the PR template that appears
7. Click **Create pull request**
8. Wait 30 seconds — the welcome bot posts a confirmation comment
9. Copy the PR URL from your browser and post it in Telegram

**If you open the PR against the wrong repo (Talent-Index instead of your fork):**
Close the PR immediately. Go to your fork's page and open a new one from there.

**If you forget to fill in the PR template:**
Edit the PR description before the Sunday midnight EAT deadline. You can edit a PR description after opening it.

## Grading rubric

All weekly deliverables are assessed on five criteria. Week 4 carries 40% of your total cohort grade. Weeks 1 through 3 together carry 60%.

| Criterion | Weight | Excellent | Good | Needs work |
|-----------|--------|-----------|------|------------|
| Functionality | 35% | All features work on Fuji testnet | Core features work | Partial or broken |
| Integration depth | 25% | Wallet + API + on-chain connected | Two layers integrated | Single component only |
| Code quality | 20% | Clean, commented, tested | Readable, some tests | Hard to follow, no tests |
| Documentation | 10% | Full README and demo video | README present | Minimal docs |
| Demo presentation | 10% | Clear, confident, live demo | Demo works with notes | Slides only, no demo |

**Grade bands:**
- Distinction: 90 to 100 percent
- Merit: 75 to 89 percent
- Pass: 60 to 74 percent
- Incomplete: below 60 percent

Certificates are awarded to builders who achieve a Pass or above AND present at Builders Connect Demo Day.

---

## Late submission policy

| Timing | Consequence |
|--------|------------|
| On time (before Sunday midnight EAT) | Full points |
| Up to 48 hours late | Accepted with 20% grade penalty |
| Beyond 48 hours | Zero for that week — you may still continue |
| Three consecutive zeros | Removal from the cohort without a certificate |

If you have a genuine emergency, message the technical lead on Telegram **before** the deadline. After the deadline, late appeals are not considered.

---

## Getting help

**Post in Telegram first.** Include three things in your message:

1. What you are trying to do
2. What you have already tried
3. The exact error message — not a paraphrase, the full text

**Office hours** run every Thursday from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM EAT on a voice call before the main session. Details are posted in Telegram. If you have a blocker, bring it to office hours.

**Tag @scotch** on Telegram only after posting in the group and not getting a response within a reasonable time.

Do not DM the technical lead directly for general questions. Post in the group so the whole community benefits from the answer.
